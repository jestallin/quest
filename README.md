# A quest in the clouds

### Q. What is this quest ?
##### A. It is a fun way to assess your cloud skills. Quest is a webapp made with node.js and golang.

### Q. What do i have to do ?
#####   1) Deploy the app in AWS and find the secret page
#####   2) Deploy the app in a Docker container
#####   3) Deploy a loadbalancer in front of the app
#####   4) Complete "Terraform"ing and/or "Cloudformation"ing the entire stack for single click deployment
#####   5) Add TLS (https)

### Q. How do i know i have solved these stages ?
#####  Each stage can be tested as follows (where <ip_or_host> is the location where the app is deployed) 
#####   1) AWS/Secret page - http(s)://<ip_or_host>[:port]/
#####   2) Docker - http(s)://<ip_or_host>[:port]/docker
#####   3) Loadbalancer - http(s)://<ip_or_host>[:port]/loadbalanced
#####   4) Terraform and/or Cloudformation - we will test your submitted templates in our account
#####   5) TLS - http(s)://<ip_or_host>[:port]/tls

### Q. Do i have to do all these ?
#####  You can do as many as you like. We suspect though that once you start you wont be able to stop. Its addictive.

### Q. What do i have to submit ?
#####   1) Terraform and/or Cloudformation template(s) (if you complete step 4)
#####   2) Dockerfile (if you complete step 2)
#####   3) Screenshot of the secret page (if you complete step 1)
#####   4) URL of your stack (if the endpoint is exposed)

### Q. What if i successfully complete all the challenges ?
#####  We have many more for you to solve as a member of the Rearc team !
